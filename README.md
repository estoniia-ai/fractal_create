# Mandelbrot Set Visualizer

This Python script uses Pygame to visualize the Mandelbrot set, a fractal that's defined as the set of complex numbers for which a particular function does not diverge when iterated from zero.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed Python 3.6 or later.
* You have a working Windows/Linux/Mac machine.

## Installing Mandelbrot Set Visualizer

To install the Mandelbrot Set Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory via the command line.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

    ```

## Using Mandelbrot Set Visualizer

To use the Mandelbrot Set Visualizer, follow these steps:

1. Run the script using Python:

    ```
    python fractal.py
    ```

2. A window should open displaying the Mandelbrot set.
3. You can click on any area within the window to zoom in on that particular spot. The fractal will redraw, showing more detail in the selected area.
4. To exit the program, close the window or press `Ctrl+C` in the command line.
